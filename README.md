This repository contains a neural network model designed to replicate the findings of the study "An Anatomically Constrained Neural Network Model of Fear Conditioning" by Jorge L. Armony, Jonathan D. Cohen, David Servan-Schreiber, and Joseph E. LeDoux. The model implements the dual-pathway theory of fear conditioning, incorporating biologically plausible mechanisms to simulate the dynamics of auditory and amygdala pathways as described in the original research.
